# MC-Java-Server-Manager
A free tool I made to manage Minecraft Servers.
[downloads, manages, starts, stops, config editor, stats, downloads curse mods, downloads forge loaders]

NOTE: 
-Updating mods isn't supported YET.
-Starting servers for the first time hangs the UI and takes time. Please be patient :)

Thanks to the following project for making the new features possible!

Requirements: Open your ports manually [Port forward/Server configs] on your router.
Depending on FireWall you're using, you might need to open them there as well.
